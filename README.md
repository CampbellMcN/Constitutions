# Constitutions
This repository contains all the data and code necessary to replicate my masters thesis: "Textual Democracy: Using panel data to understand how constitutional text relates to democracy and growth"

The study combines three publically available datasets into one panel. After some data cleaning a series of models are estimated using two-way fixed effects. The R script in this repository allows replication of my work. Users will need to set the working directory in the script to their own. 

Note: The comparative constitutions dataset ("ccpcnc_v3.csv") to too large to upload to Github. It's publically available from https://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/download-data/ (although you will have to create an account)
